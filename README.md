1. Introduction
The dataset contains  solar farm data found in Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. As Moon Light Energy Solutions aims to develop a strategic approach to significantly enhance its operational efficiency and sustainability through targeted solar investments. my analysis should focus on identifying key trends and learn valuable insights ,identifying high-potential regions for solar installation that align with the company's long-term sustainability goals. 
Identifying high-potential regions for solar installation involves evaluating a variety of factors, both environmental and socio-economic, that can influence the feasibility and effectiveness of solar energy projects.

2. Data Overview
Solar Radiation Measurement Data
The structure of the data is as follows
•	Timestamp (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm): Date and time of each observation.
•	GHI (W/m²): Global Horizontal Irradiance, the total solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface.
•	DNI (W/m²): Direct Normal Irradiance, the amount of solar radiation received per square meter on a surface perpendicular to the rays of the sun.
•	DHI (W/m²): Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance, solar radiation received per square meter on a horizontal surface that does not arrive on a direct path from the sun.
•	ModA (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (A), similar to irradiance.
•	ModB (W/m²): Measurements from a module or sensor (B), similar to irradiance.
•	Tamb (°C): Ambient Temperature in degrees Celsius.
•	RH (%): Relative Humidity as a percentage of moisture in the air.
•	WS (m/s): Wind Speed in meters per second.
•	WSgust (m/s): Maximum Wind Gust Speed in meters per second.
•	WSstdev (m/s): Standard Deviation of Wind Speed, indicating variability.
•	WD (°N (to east)): Wind Direction in degrees from north.
•	WDstdev: Standard Deviation of Wind Direction, showing directional variability.
•	BP (hPa): Barometric Pressure in hectopascals.
•	Cleaning (1 or 0): Signifying whether cleaning (possibly of the modules or sensors) occurred.
•	Precipitation (mm/min): Precipitation rate measured in millimeters per minute.
•	TModA (°C): Temperature of Module A in degrees Celsius.
•	TModB (°C): Temperature of Module B in degrees Celsius.

3. Data Summary
   There is no missing value on the 3 data sets
  The mean and standard deviation of the data sets are as follows
1, for Benin region 
          GHI                    DNI                  DHI         TAMB
Mean      240                     167                  115          28
STD       331                     261                  158           6

2, for Sierra Leone
          GHI                    DNI                  DHI         TAMB
Mean      201                     116                  113         26
STD       298                     218                  158          4

3, for Togo
          GHI                    DNI                  DHI         TAMB
Mean      230                   151                    116         27
STD       322                    250                   156          4

.as you can see on the above the mean shown as that more benin region is high solar irradiation which is good for the solar installation 

4. Exploratory Data Analysis
    . I use pandas to read the data set and i use sea born and matplotlib for data visuliazation as i  saw in the histogram for benin region the GHI is over 250000 and the DNI is over 300000 and the
   DHI is also 250000 , in sirra leone GHI over 300000 DNI 3500000 DHI 2500000 in TOGO the GHI 250000 the DNI from 300000 up to 350000 and the DHI is over 250000
   .the wind distrubtion of a togo region is high compared to the other two region and the wind distrubtion of benin is high compared to sirra leone
   .the correlation between them is more approximate  to each other
6. Conclusion
as i saw on this data set , i conclude more the sierra leone is a good and effective region for solar installition , from i saw the wind distribution the sierra leone is have less wind
the other two regions have intesive wind which is a problematic for the solar installtion.
